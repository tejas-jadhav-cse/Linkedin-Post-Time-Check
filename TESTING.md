## Testing the Application

### 1. Basic Functionality Test
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Open http://localhost:5173
3. Toggle dark mode - should persist on page refresh
4. Try the example URLs from the demo section

### 2. URL Validation Test
- Valid LinkedIn URL: Should show loading and process
- Invalid URL: Should show error message
- Empty input: Should show "Please enter a LinkedIn URL" error

### 3. Timestamp Extraction Test
Since we can't use real LinkedIn URLs in development, the app shows:
- Raw timestamp calculation from post ID
- Formatted date display
- UTC time display
- Copy to clipboard functionality

### 4. History Feature Test
1. Extract a timestamp
2. Check that it appears in history
3. Select from history to auto-fill URL
4. Clear history and verify it's empty

### 5. Responsive Design Test
- Test on mobile viewport (≤768px)
- Test on tablet viewport (769px-1024px)
- Test on desktop viewport (≥1025px)
- All elements should be properly scaled and accessible

### 6. Accessibility Test
- Tab navigation should work properly
- Focus states should be visible
- Screen reader compatible elements
- Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML

## Real-World Usage

To test with actual LinkedIn URLs:
1. Go to any LinkedIn post
2. Click the three dots (⋯) menu
3. Select "Copy link to post"
4. Paste the URL into the application
5. The timestamp should be extracted accurately
